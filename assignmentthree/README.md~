# CSE 134b Spring 2015 - Team 14 - Alex Rodriguez, Hassan Shaikley, Scott Upton, Eugene Che, Andrew Dang

Our implementation issues
 - Firefox has this policy that doesn't allow (cross origin) glyphicons unless its a server that serves from the same host. Therefore, we used Bootstrap CDN to grab the glyphicons in order for our local css and html webpages to appear. In an actual application, we wouldn't need this. 
 - Adaptive sidebar (it made it more sense to have it on the top for responsive design for mobile and web). We solve this issue with duplicate navigation, but a better way would be javascript for restructure for later assignment. 
 - We had problems dealing with css column problems, but we restructure it accordingly by col-6 and col-sm-6 to have it be correct.
